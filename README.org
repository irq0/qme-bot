* Idea
Jabber bot that asks me a couple of questions each morning. I reply my
answers; bot stores replies somewhere.

** Example
- Question :: How many hours of sleep?
- Answer :: "10:54"
- Record path :: qme.seri.bot.sleep.minutes
- Conversion :: /some function/


* Features
** TODO Conversions
- [X] simple HH:MM format
- [ ] on a scale from 1 to 10

** Jabber Bot
Connects and asks questions. Checks answers, asks again if necessary.

* Configuration
Put jid, password in config.py

* Dependencies
